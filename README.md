## HW10

**1.Description of how you encoded seconds into lights.**. 
I have one led light up after 10 seconds, signalling 60 seconds, then all the leds turn off and start up again one by one after 10 seconds.
for my layout, I used 3 yellow and 3 red bulbs, simulating the lighting on my sunrise allarm clock.
